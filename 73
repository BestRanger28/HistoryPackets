EdgarHoover.=====This present-day body of water’s fishing industry, based in towns such as Karateren, relies mostlyon bream and carp and has increased sharply since 2005. This body of water is located in its country’sKyzylorda Region, and a former port town that partially shares its name with this body of water is now20 kilometers from its shores. The 2005 installation of a dike on its south coast has allowed this lake tokeep more water from the Syr Darya River, whose over-irrigation led to this lake’s creation. For the pointname this portion of a formerly large inland sea, a recently-formed lake located entirely in Kazakhstan.=====Mzilikazi [m’zili-kazi] served as one of this man’s generals before founding his own kingdom, andHenry Francis Fynn served as a doctor at this leader’s court. This leader ordered all of the milk cows inhis realm slaughtered after his mother’s death. A series of migrations called the mfecane [m’feh-cah-nay]caused by this leader led to the creation of groups like the Ndebele [de-beh-lay], and this leader pioneeredthe use of a stabbing spear that replaced the assegai, the iklwa. For the point, name this Zulu conqueror.=====One monarch with this name was the subject of a poem labeling him “warlike as a pard, sweet as aspikenard.” Another monarch of this name was overthrown by an invasion coordinated by Roger Mortimerand his wife, Isabella of France; that monarch with this name may have had an affair with the courtierPiers Gaveston. Another monarch of this name was nicknamed “Hammer of the Scots” for his defeat ofWilliam Wallace. For the point, give this royal name shared by a 20th century ruler who abdicated tomarry Wallis Simpson and by a 13th century ruler nicknamed “Longshanks.”=====The inspiration for this novel came from the author’s realization that tales he read in Centurymagazines were “emotionless as rocks.” A character in this novel has what seems to be a “profounddignity in the firm lines of his awful face,” but dies with “an expression of every agony” in front of theprotagonist. Jim Conklin dies in front of Henry Fleming, a young private in the 304th New York Regimentwho wishes he had proof of valor. For the point, name this Civil War novel by Stephen Crane.=====Fritz Kuhn led a group that sought to promote this regime in the US, using Camp Norland asits largest headquarters. An embrace of Savitri Devi splintered a group that used this regime’s ideologyand was founded by George Lincoln Rockwell. A group promoting this regime’s ideology unsuccessfullymarched in Skokie, Illinois. Charles Lindbergh’s America First Committee opposed America entering awar against this country until Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. For the point, name this regime led by AdolfHitler.=====A rhyming slogan coined in this country in 1672 described it as senseless, leaderless, and rudderlessduring its “year of disaster,” which culminated in the lynching of the De Witt brothers. Balthasar Gerardassassinated a monarch from this country, where the Duke of Alva used brutal tactics in a failed attemptto crush a revolt during the Eighty Years’ War that culminated in its independence. For the point, namethis country that was led by Stadtholders like William the Silent.=====An American consul in this modern-day country wrote the Blood Telegram during the genocidalOperation Searchlight, which was supervised by General Tikka Khan. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman led thiscountry’s pro-independence party, the Awami League, which won legislative elections in the country thatcontrolled it in 1971. This country’s independence was secured by an Indian invasion after refugees floodedcities like Kolkata from this country. For the point, name this country that was known as East Pakistanbefore its independence and which now has its capital at Dhaka.=====This colonel may have committed a war crime when he ambushed a group of Canadians under JosephJumonville during peacetime. As a member of the Virginia Regiment, the first professional Americanforce, this man led the Forbes expedition to capture Fort Duquesne [do-cane]. Upon that expedition’sfailure, this man was forced to build and then surrender Fort Necessity in 1754, helping start the Frenchand Indian War. For the point, name this American general who later served as commander-in-chief ofthe Continental Army during the American Revolution.=====
