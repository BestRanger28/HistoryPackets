The criminal “Soapy” Smith” ran organized crime in Colorado and what is now this state, where he
died. With Louisiana, this is the only U.S. state that does not have counties. Over a hundred people died
in this state during the 1964 Good Friday earthquake, which triggered tsunamis that killed five people in
Oregon. The purchase of this future state, at the price of 2 cents per acre, was dubbed “Seward’s Folly.”
For the point, what future state was bought from Russia in 1867?=====
Alaska
