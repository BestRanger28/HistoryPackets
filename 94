This man’s alleged last words were “The battle is at its height - wear my armor and beat my war
drums. Do not announce my death.” After his death, this man was given the title Chunmugong. A double
agent plot led to the removal of this man in favor of a commander who was decisively defeated at the
Battle of Chilchonryang. This man was killed during his final victory at the Battle of Noryang, after he
defeated 330 Japanese ships with 13 at the Battle of Myeongnyang. For the point, name this “Nelson of
the East”, a Korean admiral who championed turtle ships.=====
