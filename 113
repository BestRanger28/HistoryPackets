One leader at this battle changed his mind in the middle of a counterattack when a 
nobleman asked “would you go upon your death?” The Earl of Carnwath was partly blamed 
for losing this battle, which helped bring about a surrender at Truro. The victorious side at 
this battle, which was fought in Northamptonshire, took damage on its left wing under the 
command of Henry Ireton, who faced an assault by Prince Rupert. For the point, name this 
decisive June 1645 victory for Oliver Cromwell.=====
