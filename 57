This man’s staff doctored photos of Millard Tydings in a smear campaign. Joseph Welch attacked the
“cruelty” of this man, who gave a speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, where he claimed to hold a list of
205 names. He was censured by the Senate in 1954 shortly after he investigated the Army in unpopular
hearings. For the point, name this Wisconsin Senator who aggressively investigated Communists during
the 1950’s Red Scare.=====
