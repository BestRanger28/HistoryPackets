This body of water is home to ruins linked with the Tiwanaku [[tee-wah-NAH-koo]] 
people, who possibly built a massive, now-ruined temple on the Isla de la Luna. Thor 
Heyerdahl's Ra II [[TWO]] was constructed by the reed craftsmen from Suriki in this lake. 
The first warship to navigate this lake was the gunboat Colo Colo, sent by Chile to threaten 
two other countries during the War of the Pacific. For the point, name this "highest 
navigable lake" in the world, lying between Peru and Bolivia.=====
