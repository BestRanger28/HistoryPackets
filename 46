An urban legend from this city named Pérák, or "The Spring Man," inspired this 
city's residents to disobey a Nazi curfew. At an event named for this city, which included the 
"Action Programme," Jan Palach set himself on fire. The declaration of “Socialism with a 
human face” was a liberalizing ideology pioneered by Alexander Dubček [[DOOB-chek]] 
during a 1968 event in this city, which was ended by a Soviet crackdown. An anti-Soviet 
"Spring" took place in, for the point, what capital of modern Czechia?=====
