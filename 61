This battle occurred after one side ignored the advice of Mikhail Kutuzov to retreat into Carpathia,
after being defeated during the Ulm Campaign. The winning commander here strategically deployed
below the Pratzen Heights, only to retake them later in a daring charge. Its aftermath led to the creation
of the Confederation of the Rhine and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. For the point, name
this 1805 victory by Napoleon over the forces of Austria and Russia.=====
