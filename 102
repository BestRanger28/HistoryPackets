This country’s troops renamed Fort Casimir as Fort Trinity after its capture. This European power
exclusively traded firearms to their Native American allies, the Susquehannocks. This country built the
first colony along the Delaware River at present-day Wilmington during a voyage in which this country’s
people were led by the Dutch captain Peter Minuit. Log cabins were introduced to North America by this
country, whose colonial ambitions were effectively ended when Peter Stuyvesant captured Fort Christina.
For the point, name this country that colonized what is now Bridgeport, New Jersey as “New Stockholm.”=====
