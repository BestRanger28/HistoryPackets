This battle was followed by a series of harsh winter rains that led the losing side to experience the
infamous “Mud March.” The winning side in this battle was able to set up defenses along Marye’s Heights
after the losing side experienced delays in setting pontoon bridges across the Rappahannock. Joseph
Hooker was appointed commander of the Army of the Potomac shortly after this battle. For the point,
