A letter by Leonel Sharp provides this work’s most widely accepted text, including the promises
“you have deserved rewards and crowns” and “we shall shortly have a famous victory.” In this speech,
the speaker thinks “foul scorn that Parma or Spain [...] should dare to invade the borders of my realm”
before promising to take up arms, despite having a “weak, feeble” body. For the point, name this 1588
speech delivered to an army awaiting the landing of the Spanish Armada by a leader who had the “heart
and stomach of a King,” Elizabeth I.=====
